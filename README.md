## About

RatioMaster is a small standalone application which fakes upload and download stats of a torrent to almost all bittorrent trackers.

This means that it does NOT rely on your bittorrent client (uTorrent, Azureus, BitComet, ABC and etc.) and it will NOT download/upload the files on a torrent - it only can fake download/upload.

RatioMaster has hardcoded emulations for the most commonly used BitTorrent clients: uTorrent, BitComet, Azureus, ABC, BitLord, BTuga, BitTornado, Burst, BitTyrant, BitSpirit.
